## Car Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to predict the price of cars using multiple linear regression.

### Project Overview

The aim of this project is to create a regression model that predicts car prices based on a set of features such as age, horsepower, brand, and engine capacity.
The final model is evaluated using standard regression metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

### Project Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data cleaning (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).
   - Feature engineering (creating new features and scaling existing ones).
2. **Model Building**:
   - We employ **Multiple Linear Regression** as the main regression model to predict car prices.
3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The model is evaluated on the test dataset using various metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared.
   - Visualizations are used to compare actual vs predicted car prices.

### Key Features
- **Regression Analysis**: The multiple linear regression model is trained using key features and tested on unseen data to evaluate its predictive performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the model using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² to measure how well it generalizes to new data.

### Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model building, feature selection (RFE), and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the results.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/car-price-prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook carprice.ipynb
   ```

### Example Output

The model will provide the following output:
- **Predicted vs Actual Prices**: A comparison between the predicted car prices and the actual values from the test set.
- **Regression Metrics**:
  - Mean Absolute Error: e.g., 3061.61
  - Mean Squared Error: e.g., 15514797.07
  - Root Mean Squared Error: e.g., 3938.88

### Information Regarding the Above Graph

The graph titled **"Actual vs Predicted Values"** provides a visual comparison between the **actual car prices** (test data) and the **predicted car prices** (model predictions). Here's an explanation of the elements:

1. **X-axis (Data Points)**:
   - Represents the individual data points from the test set (index of cars in the dataset).

2. **Y-axis (Target Data)**:
   - Represents the car price values. Both actual and predicted prices are plotted against this axis.

3. **Orange Line with Circles**:
   - This line represents the **actual car prices** from the test dataset. Each point shows the true price of a car.

4. **Red Dashed Line with X Markers**:
   - This dashed line represents the **predicted car prices** from the model. Each point shows the price predicted by the machine learning model for a particular car.

5. **Observations**:
   - In most cases, the predicted values closely follow the actual values, indicating the model is performing reasonably well.
   - Some deviations are visible where the red dashed line (predicted) does not align perfectly with the orange line (actual). This suggests that the model may have made errors for those particular data points.

6. **Overall Performance**:
   - The graph provides a quick visual confirmation that the model is generally capturing the trend of the car prices, although there are a few outliers or deviations.
   - The close alignment between the lines suggests that the model predictions are fairly accurate, but there is room for further optimization, especially for the peaks and troughs.

This graph can be used to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data, and any large deviations might point to areas for model improvement.
### Future Improvements

- **Incorporating additional features** like car type, fuel efficiency, or transmission type could further improve prediction accuracy.
- **Experimenting with different algorithms** such as decision trees, random forests, or XGBoost for comparison against linear regression.

### Conclusion

This project provides a practical example of how to apply machine learning and statistical techniques to real-world data, allowing us to accurately predict car prices based on relevant features.
